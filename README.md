# PageRank_Improved
This is a personal class project for *Data Warehoursing and Data Mining*. It studies various improvements for PageRank and HITS algorithms.
Experimental results are listed in the '.pdf' document, which is written in Chinese.
## Improvements I made
* Matrix power accelerated subspace iteration
* Optimization for sparse matrix
* Optimization for the initial value of the iteration
* Quadratic extrapolation
* Fixing convergence value
